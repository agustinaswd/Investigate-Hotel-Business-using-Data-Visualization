# Hi, Nice to meet you!
This is my 2nd Mini Project that I got at Bootcamp Data Science Rakamin Academy. <br />

In this Mini Project, I'm a member of the Data Scientist team at a hotel company. As a member of the Data Scientist team, I'm responsible for providing insights related to hotel business performance. These insights can be searched by data exploration, such as analyzing how customers behave in ordering hotel tickets or looking for factors that influence the cancellation of hotel ticket bookings. Then present the insights I get using visualization and data storytelling. <br />
